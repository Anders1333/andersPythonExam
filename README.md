# Wound Recognition (Python 3.7.x)
Talented Direction - Anders (cph-ac172) Jonas (cph-ja213) Rune (cph-rm129)


We will make a program to identify wound types based on images, using a machine learning approach.

Users will be able to upload an image, which will then be processed and one of the following wound features wille be identified: 

- Necrosis
- Fibrin
- Superficial(e.g bruises or low-depth wounds)

# Dependencies
This program depends on the folowing modules:

- os, urllib, flask, selenium, numpy keras, tensorflow, opencv, 
- keras, json, time, urllib, pickle, random

#Installation
How to run the code:
1 Clone the project

2 Cd into the directory of the project

then from you cmd type:

3 python main.py image_gui (ui of images to select from) 

4  python main.py cleanup (remove images)
  
5  python main.py get_images (all images)

6 python main.py training (training and makeing the model)

7 python main.py watson (using watson to classify the images)
