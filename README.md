We will make a program to identify wound types based on images, using a machine learning approach.

Users will be able to upload an image, which will then be processed and one of the following wound features wille be identified: 

- Necrosis
- Fibrin
- Superficial(e.g bruises or low-depth wounds)


Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- json

- time

- os

- urllib

- pickle

- random

- flask

- opencv

- keras

- tensorflow

- watson_developer_cloud

- numpy

- selenium

How to run the code:
1 Clone the project

2 Cd into the directory of the project

then from you cmd type:

3 python main.py image_gui (ui of images to select from) 

4  python main.py cleanup (remove images)
  
5  python main.py get_images (all images)

6 python main.py training (training and makeing the model)

7 python main.py watson (using watson to classify the images)
